# iWish
iWish is an app dedicated to helping people organize the gifting process.
- Every user has a list of gifts he or she would like to get for a special occasion.
- You can add friends and see what gifts they want.
- You can book a friend's gift so that different people are not gifting the same thing.
- When booking your friend's gift, no one can see who booked that gift.
Â  but everyone except for this friend can see that the gift is booked. (An idea to develop)
- An app has recommendations for gifts for particular types of special occasions: Christmas, birthdays, International Women's Day, etc.
